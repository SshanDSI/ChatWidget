Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the most effective treatment in the world for the most common cause of chronic back pain: painful, inflamed annular tears within an injured discs back wall. Chronic means back pain lasting or recurring for more than 6 weeks. It is known that 85% of all chronic back pain comes from inflammation within the tears found in the back walls of injured spinal discs. The key role that inflammation plays in discogenic back pain was discovered endoscopically by founding neurosurgeon Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD in 2007 and remains the basis of the Deuk Laser Disc Repair treatment. Painful annular tears are found within herniated, slipped, ruptured, bulging, protruding, extruded and degenerated discs in the spine.

Injured discs such as disc herniation, disc bulge, slipped disc, disc protrusion, disc extrusion, disc degeneration, and spondylosis account for 85% of all chronic thoracic pain. Disc injuries are by far the most common cause of thoracic pain. Damaged facet joints such as facet arthropathy and hypertrophy are the second most common cause of chronic thoracic pain accounting for 10% in total. Finally, less than 5% of chronic thoracic pain is due to less common pain generators including vertebral fracture, tumor and infection. Correct diagnosis of a patients specific pain generators requires a specialized physical exam and a recent thoracic MRI scan. Occasionally, diagnostic nerve blocks are needed to aid in the diagnosis of facet joint pain. Bone scans can be helpful in determining if there is a painful fracture.

    "question": "What is the main benefit of the minimally invasive Deuk Laser Disc Repair compared to more invasive surgeries?",
    "retrieval_context": "Restore Spinal Stability\r\nSpinal instability was originally defined in 1978 by Dr. White MD and Dr. Panjabi PhD as the inability of the spine under normal physiological loads to prevent deformation causing thoracic pain or neurological compromise. Spinal disc injuries including herniated and bulging discs are the most common cause of spinal instability. Procedures that eliminate thoracic pain or nerve root symptoms by definition enhance spinal stability. Many procedures have the capacity to improve symptoms of spinal instability, but few provide lasting results. Some of the procedures are highly invasive causing more injury to the patients body than just the spine. Invasive spine surgery includes laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement, interspinous devices and spinal cord stimulators. Invasive spine surgery always permanently damages soft tissues, bone and joints around the spine leading to long term instability and the need for additional spine surgery.\r\nThe Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the only procedure capable of stabilizing the spine without causing collateral damage to spinal muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons. A small  inch incision is made in the skin and the rest of the surgery is performed endoscopically without internal damage or scar tissue. Pain relief is immediate and most patients experience neurological improvement within 24 hours. Deuk Laser Disc Repair is capable of restoring spinal stability.

The average blood loss for a Deuk Laser Disc Repair is 1.5 milliliters or about 30 drops. The average blood loss for invasive spine surgery is 100 times more than with Deuk Laser Disc Repair. While blood transfusions are uncommon in minimally invasive spine surgery, excessive blood loss is not uncommon with invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement and spinal devices. Blood loss over 1,500 milliliters has been reported with invasive spine surgery leading to cardiovascular collapse and death.

To see if you are a candidate for Deuk Laser Disc Repair please complete ourFree MRI Review\r\nFree MRI Review : https://deukspine.com/free-mri-review Avoid Opioid Narcotic Painkillers\r\nSpine surgery without post operative opioid narcotic painkillers is possible with the Deuk Laser Disc Repair. Invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous devices, spinal fusion and disc replacement always require dangerous post operative opioid narcotic painkillers because these types of surgery cause tremendous damage to your body internally during the surgery. The internal damage cannot be seen under the incision but it is felt by patients as post-surgical pain for months. Most invasive spine surgery patients stay in the hospital overnight taking powerful opioid narcotic painkillers and continue taking them for months after surgery for the pain they experience. What invasive spine surgeons dont tell patients is just how damaging their surgery is to the body and it is all hidden from sight under those scars. The actual source of post-operative pain is dying muscles, bones and ligaments ripped off of your spine while you are sleeping under anesthesia. The invasive surgery destroys muscles along the front of the spine by ripping them off the spine which causes them to melt away for months after the surgery turning them into a stew and eventually hard scar tissue. Dont be fooled into believing this wont happen to you. Liquification of muscles, tendons, bone and ligaments happens in ALL invasive spine surgery which is why you will have so much pain after invasive surgery and require opioid narcotic painkillers for weeks or longer. All patients undergoing invasive spine surgery are at high risk of becoming dependent on painkillers.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is truly minimally invasive spine surgery and causes no known internal damage. Patients have no surgical pain the day after their surgery and no post operative painkillers are needed. Since post operative opioid narcotic painkillers are not needed by patients undergoing the Deuk Laser Disc Repair, patients dont have to worry about becoming addicted to painkillers. Patients can return to work or driving a car the day after their surgery. Most of our patients take one Tylenol the night after surgery and nothing else.

Using a minimally invasive, endoscopic technique through a 4 mm skin incision, the painful annular tear is located at the back of the injured painful disc. Treatment of the painful tissue within the annular tear is performed using an FDA approved Holmium YAG laser under the direction of a highly trained Deuk Spine Institute surgeon. The surgeon will precisely remove herniated disc, inflammatory tissue, bone spurs, calcium deposits and scar tissue from the posterior annular tear and epidural space around the nerve root. Upon completion of the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, the now painless annular tear will begin healing naturally. It takes 9-12 months for the repaired annular tear to completely heal.

To see if you are a candidate for Deuk Laser Disc Repair please complete ourFree MRI Review\r\nFree MRI Review : https://deukspine.com/free-mri-review Avoid Opioid Narcotic Painkillers\r\nSpine surgery without post operative opioid narcotic painkillers is possible with the Deuk Laser Disc Repair. Invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous devices, spinal fusion and disc replacement always require dangerous post operative opioid narcotic painkillers because these types of surgery cause tremendous damage to your body internally during the surgery. The internal damage cannot be seen under the incision but it is felt by patients as post-surgical pain for months. Most invasive spine surgery patients stay in the hospital overnight taking powerful opioid narcotic painkillers and continue taking them for months after surgery for the pain they experience. What invasive spine surgeons dont tell patients is just how damaging their surgery is to the body and it is all hidden from sight under those scars. The actual source of post-operative pain is dying muscles, bones and ligaments ripped off of your spine while you are sleeping under anesthesia. The invasive surgery destroys muscles along the front of the spine by ripping them off the spine which causes them to melt away for months after the surgery turning them into a stew and eventually hard scar tissue. Dont be fooled into believing this wont happen to you. Liquification of muscles, tendons, bone and ligaments happens in ALL invasive spine surgery which is why you will have so much pain after invasive surgery and require opioid narcotic painkillers for weeks or longer. All patients undergoing invasive spine surgery are at high risk of becoming dependent on painkillers.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is truly minimally invasive spine surgery and causes no known internal damage. Patients have no surgical pain the day after their surgery and no post operative painkillers are needed. Since post operative opioid narcotic painkillers are not needed by patients undergoing the Deuk Laser Disc Repair, patients dont have to worry about becoming addicted to painkillers. Patients can return to work or driving a car the day after their surgery. Most of our patients take one Tylenol the night after surgery and nothing else.

    "retrieval_context": "Motion Preserving\r\nSpinal discs are normally painless joints made for movement, giving the thoracic its flexibility needed for regular daily activities. The ideal treatment for a painful disc would successfully eliminate thoracic pain while preserving the natural movement of the disc. Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patient’s body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patient’s natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair® is different because there is no collateral damage or instability from the procedure. Deuk Laser Disc Repair® uses a small ¼ inch skin incision and natural openings already present in the spine to access and treat painful injured discs. Unlike invasive spine surgery, Deuk Laser Disc Repair® is a minimally invasive, nontraumatic endoscopic procedure that gently separates delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding or scarring. Since bone, muscle, ligament and joint are unharmed during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair® procedure, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. The entire surgery is completed endoscopically under twilight anesthesia with same day discharge.

Unlike invasive spine surgery, which can permanently damage the spine, the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure is minimally invasive and uses natural openings already present in the spine. This allows the surgeon to gently separate delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding, or scarring. As a result, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. </p>",

    "question": "Discuss the role of inflammation in the pathology of discogenic thoracic pain as treated by Deuk Laser Disc Repair.",
    "retrieval_context": "Most Effective Treatment for Back Pain\r\nChronic back pain has a few causes of which disc injuries are the most common. Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the most effective treatment in the world for the most common cause of chronic back pain: painful, inflamed annular tears within an injured discs back wall. Chronic means back pain lasting or recurring for more than 6 weeks. It is known that 85% of all chronic back pain comes from inflammation within the tears found in the back walls of injured spinal discs. The key role that inflammation plays in discogenic back pain was discovered endoscopically by founding neurosurgeon Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD in 2007 and remains the basis of the Deuk Laser Disc Repair treatment. Painful annular tears are found within herniated, slipped, ruptured, bulging, protruding, extruded and degenerated discs in the spine. The Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure directly targets and debrides painful annular tears with laser energy and precision. Discogenic back pain is eliminated completely and immediately with the treatment.

Fifty distinct sources of chronic thoracic spine pain are now known. Most patients with chronic thoracic pain have more than one source. The actual source of a patients pain is referred to as the \"pain generator\". The most common pain generator for chronic thoracic pain is injured discs in the thoracic spine. Injured discs such as disc herniation, disc bulge, slipped disc, disc protrusion, disc extrusion, disc degeneration, and spondylosis account for 85% of all chronic thoracic pain. Disc injuries are by far the most common cause of thoracic pain. Damaged facet joints such as facet arthropathy and hypertrophy are the second most common cause of chronic thoracic pain accounting for 10% in total. Finally, less than 5% of chronic thoracic pain is due to less common pain generators including vertebral fracture, tumor and infection. Correct diagnosis of a patients specific pain generators requires a specialized physical exam and a recent thoracic MRI scan. Occasionally, diagnostic nerve blocks are needed to aid in the diagnosis of facet joint pain. Bone scans can be helpful in determining if there is a painful fracture. Although many people suffer with chronic thoracic pain, each patient is unique in how they experience pain.\r\nFree MRI Review : https://deukspine.com/free-mri-review",

    "question": " What are the findings concerning problematic spinal stenosis discovered by Deuk Spine Institute?",
    "retrieval_context": "Spinal Stenosis\r\nSpinal stenosis is a common finding on MRI scans done for thoracic pain or pinched nerves. Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the natural channels or holes in the spine. Often nerves run through these channels or holes. If the narrowing is severe enough a pinched nerve will occur. Pinched nerves can cause chest wall weakness, numbness, tingling or shooting pain around the ribs (radiculitis). Spinal stenosis or pinched nerves do NOT cause thoracic pain, only radiating pain can occur. Thoracic spine pain usually comes from disc injuries, for example herniated discs, bulging discs and degenerated discs. The most frequent cause of spinal stenosis is a herniated or bulging disc. This is why thoracic pain and spinal stenosis are commonly found together. Both can be effectively treated with Deuk Laser Disc Repair.\r\nThere are 4 zones in the spine where stenosis can occur. They are from medial to lateral: central, lateral recess, neural foramen and extra-foraminal. The most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the lateral recess. The next most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the neural-foramen. Deuk Spine Institute independently discovered that 98% of problematic spinal stenosis occurs in the lateral recess and neuro-foramen, a fact most doctors are unaware of. Spine surgeons and radiologists are typically only looking for central stenosis and often miss the actual cause of a patients stenosis symptoms, lateral recess and foraminal stenosis. Failure to diagnose and treat the actual source of a pinched nerve is the most common cause of failed thoracic surgery syndrome where patients have spine surgery that doesnt work and they are in more pain after surgery. As a result of doctors missing the diagnosis, patients often suffer in pain. Deuk Spine Institute is your trusted partner with a 99% diagnostic accuracy for spine conditions.\r\nSpinal stenosis and its associated symptoms are completely curable with the safe and effective treatments available at Deuk Spine Institute. Since the most common cause of spinal stenosis is a bulging disc in the lateral recess or neuroforamen, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the preferred treatment for pinched nerves. After the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, rib symptoms such as pain, weakness, heaviness, numbness and tingling usually go away permanently. Rib pain often resolves first within 1-2 days of treatment while numbness and weakness may take up to 12 months after surgery. Deuk Spine Institute is able to perform all known treatments for spinal stenosis however we have found the best treatment for spinal stenosis to be the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure.",

Invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous devices, spinal fusion and disc replacement always require dangerous post operative opioid narcotic painkillers because these types of surgery cause tremendous damage to your body internally during the surgery. The internal damage cannot be seen under the incision but it is felt by patients as post-surgical pain for months. Most invasive spine surgery patients stay in the hospital overnight taking powerful opioid narcotic painkillers and continue taking them for months after surgery for the pain they experience. What invasive spine surgeons dont tell patients is just how damaging their surgery is to the body and it is all hidden from sight under those scars. The actual source of post-operative pain is dying muscles, bones and ligaments ripped off of your spine while you are sleeping under anesthesia. The invasive surgery destroys muscles along the front of the spine by ripping them off the spine which causes them to melt away for months after the surgery turning them into a stew and eventually hard scar tissue. Dont be fooled into believing this wont happen to you. Liquification of muscles, tendons, bone and ligaments happens in ALL invasive spine surgery which is why you will have so much pain after invasive surgery and require opioid narcotic painkillers for weeks or longer. All patients undergoing invasive spine surgery are at high risk of becoming dependent on painkillers.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is truly minimally invasive spine surgery and causes no known internal damage. Patients have no surgical pain the day after their surgery and no post operative painkillers are needed. Since post operative opioid narcotic painkillers are not needed by patients undergoing the Deuk Laser Disc Repair, patients dont have to worry about becoming addicted to painkillers.

    "question": "How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair compare to traditional spine surgeries regarding safety and complication rates?",
    "retrieval_context": "Restore Spinal Stability\r\nSpinal instability was originally defined in 1978 by Dr. White MD and Dr. Panjabi PhD as the inability of the spine under normal physiological loads to prevent deformation causing thoracic pain or neurological compromise. Spinal disc injuries including herniated and bulging discs are the most common cause of spinal instability. Procedures that eliminate thoracic pain or nerve root symptoms by definition enhance spinal stability. Many procedures have the capacity to improve symptoms of spinal instability, but few provide lasting results. Some of the procedures are highly invasive causing more injury to the patients body than just the spine. Invasive spine surgery includes laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement, interspinous devices and spinal cord stimulators. Invasive spine surgery always permanently damages soft tissues, bone and joints around the spine leading to long term instability and the need for additional spine surgery.\r\nThe Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the only procedure capable of stabilizing the spine without causing collateral damage to spinal muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons. A small  inch incision is made in the skin and the rest of the surgery is performed endoscopically without internal damage or scar tissue. Pain relief is immediate and most patients experience neurological improvement within 24 hours. Deuk Laser Disc Repair is capable of restoring spinal stability.

The average blood loss for a Deuk Laser Disc Repair is 1.5 milliliters or about 30 drops. The average blood loss for invasive spine surgery is 100 times more than with Deuk Laser Disc Repair. While blood transfusions are uncommon in minimally invasive spine surgery, excessive blood loss is not uncommon with invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement and spinal devices. Blood loss over 1,500 milliliters has been reported with invasive spine surgery leading to cardiovascular collapse and death.

    "actual_output": "<p> Deuk Laser Disc Repair has the safest spine surgery profile with documented fewer than 1 complication per 1,000 surgeries. Invasive spine surgery is known to have serious complications associated with bad outcomes. The invasive nature of laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement and spinal implants predispose patients to major serious complications including death from blood clots, infection, stroke, myocardial infarction (heart attack), pneumonia and shock multisystem organ failure. Less serious but more common complications of invasive spine surgery include implant misplacement, migration, loosening, breakage or failure, bone graft related osteonecrosis, heterotopic ossification, osteolysis and resorption; wound infection and non-healing, dural misadventures like spinal fluid lead, nerve root injuries and scarring, muscle damage, scarring and atrophy, residual stenosis or instability, blood vessel injury with pseudoaneurysm, dissection, obstruction leading to gangrene and amputation, bowel perforation, kidney injury; esophageal injury, perforation and dysphagia; hoarseness, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, lymphatic injury, sympathetic trunk injury, Horners Syndrome, just to name a few of the common complications seen with invasive spine surgery but not with Deuk Laser Disc Repair. </p>",
