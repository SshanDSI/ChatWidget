    "question": "What is the main benefit of Deuk Laser Disc Repair compared to more invasive spine surgeries?",
    "retrieval_context": "Restore Spinal Stability\r\nSpinal instability was originally defined in 1978 by Dr. White MD and Dr. Panjabi PhD as the inability of the spine under normal physiological loads to prevent deformation causing back pain or neurological compromise. Spinal disc injuries including herniated and bulging discs are the most common cause of spinal instability. Procedures that eliminate back pain or nerve root symptoms by definition enhance spinal stability. Many procedures have the capacity to improve symptoms of spinal instability, but few provide lasting results. Some of the procedures are highly invasive causing more injury to the patients body than just the spine. Invasive spine surgery includes laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement, interspinous devices and spinal cord stimulators. Invasive spine surgery always permanently damages soft tissues, joints and bone around the spine leading to long term instability and the need for additional spine surgery.\r\nThe Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the only procedure capable of stabilizing the spine without causing collateral damage to spinal muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons. A small  inch incision is made in the skin and the rest of the surgery is performed endoscopically without internal damage or scar tissue. Pain relief is immediate and most patients experience neurological improvement within 24 hours. Deuk Laser Disc Repair is capable of restoring spinal stability.

The average blood loss for a Deuk Laser Disc Repair is 1.5 milliliters or about 30 drops. The average blood loss for invasive spine surgery is 100 times more. While blood transfusions are uncommon in surgery, excessive blood loss is not uncommon with invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement and spinal devices. Blood loss over 1,500 milliliters has been reported with invasive spine surgery leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Peace of mind before surgery is important and no spine surgery affords greater safety and reliability than Deuk Laser Disc Repair. Treat yourself to the best spine surgery available.

    "retrieval_context": "Permanent Relief\r\nChronic back pain can be cured when the exact source of pain is identified and properly treated. Thirty distinct sources of chronic back pain are now known. Most patients with chronic back pain have more than one source. The actual source of a patients pain is referred to as the \"pain generator\". The most common pain generator for chronic back pain is injured discs in the lumbar spine. Injured discs such as disc herniation, disc bulge, slipped disc, disc protrusion, disc extrusion, disc degeneration, and spondylosis account for 85% of all chronic back pain. Disc injuries are by far the most common cause of back pain. Damaged facet joints such as facet arthropathy and hypertrophy are the second most common cause of chronic back pain accounting for 10% in total. Finally, 5% of chronic back pain is due to less common pain generators including the sacroiliac joints, vertebral body fracture, piriformis muscle and the coccygeal ligament. Correct diagnosis of a patients specific pain generators requires a specialized physical exam and a recent lumbar MRI scan. Occasionally, diagnostic nerve blocks are needed to aid in the diagnosis. Although many people suffer with chronic lower back pain, each patient is unique in how they experience pain.\r\nDeuk Spine Institute is the first medical facility in the world to achieve 99% diagnostic accuracy identifying lower back pain generators through its use of advanced medical imaging combined with a proprietary physical exam technique developed at Deuk Spine Institute called the Deuk Spine Exam. The Deuk Spine Exam uses novel back pain mapping technology to identify back pain generators with real time diagnostic accuracy over 99%. Unfortunately, most doctors worldwide still believe back pain to be nonspecific having no identifiable source, thus leaving patients with no hope for a successful treatment recommendation. Subsequently, many back pain treatments are done without an accurate diagnosis therefore the treatments are ineffective or short lived. Deuk Spine Institutes lead researcher, Arias Deukmedjian and founder Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD were the first to discover that most (85%) chronic back pain originates from a microscopic tear in the posterior annulus fibrosus (wall) of the disc. While unable to heal on its own, the annular tear can be seen and repaired during endoscopic spine surgery.

Finally, 5% of chronic back pain is due to less common pain generators including the sacroiliac joints, vertebral body fracture, piriformis muscle and the coccygeal ligament. Correct diagnosis of a patients specific pain generators requires a specialized physical exam and a recent lumbar MRI scan. Occasionally, diagnostic nerve blocks are needed to aid in the diagnosis. Although many people suffer with chronic lower back pain, each patient is unique in how they experience pain.\r\nDeuk Spine Institute is the first medical facility in the world to achieve 99% diagnostic accuracy identifying lower back pain generators through its use of advanced medical imaging combined with a proprietary physical exam technique developed at Deuk Spine Institute called the Deuk Spine Exam. The Deuk Spine Exam uses novel back pain mapping technology to identify back pain generators with real time diagnostic accuracy over 99%. Unfortunately, most doctors worldwide still believe back pain to be nonspecific having no identifiable source, thus leaving patients with no hope for a successful treatment recommendation. Subsequently, many back pain treatments are done without an accurate diagnosis therefore the treatments are ineffective or short lived. Deuk Spine Institutes lead researcher, Arias Deukmedjian and founder Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD were the first to discover that most (85%) chronic back pain originates from a microscopic tear in the posterior annulus fibrosus (wall) of the disc.

    "question": "What problems does spinal stenosis typically cause, and how effective is Deuk Laser Disc Repair in treating it?",
    "retrieval_context": "Spinal Stenosis\r\nSpinal stenosis is a common finding on MRI scans done for back pain or sciatica. Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the natural channels or holes in the spine. Often nerves run through these channels or holes. If the narrowing is severe enough a pinched nerve will occur. Pinched nerves can cause leg weakness, numbness, tingling or shooting pain down the leg (sciatica). Spinal stenosis or pinched nerves do NOT cause back pain, only leg pain can occur. Back pain usually comes from disc injuries, for example herniated or bulging discs. The most frequent cause of spinal stenosis is a herniated or bulging disc. This is why back pain and spinal stenosis are commonly found together.\r\nThere are 4 zones in the spine where stenosis can occur. They are from medial to lateral: central, lateral recess, neural foramen and extra-foraminal. The most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the lateral recess. The next most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the neural-foramen. Deuk Spine Institute independently discovered that 98% of problematic spinal stenosis occurs in the lateral recess and neuro-foramen, a fact most doctors are unaware of. Spine surgeons and radiologists are typically only looking for central stenosis and often miss the actual cause of a patients stenosis symptoms, lateral recess and foraminal stenosis. Failure to diagnose and treat the actual source of a pinched nerve is the most common cause of failed back surgery syndrome where patients have spine surgery that doesnt work and they are in more pain after surgery. As a result of doctors missing the diagnosis, patients often suffer in pain. Deuk Spine Institute is your trusted partner with a 99% diagnostic accuracy for spine conditions.\r\nSpinal stenosis and its associated symptoms are completely curable with the safe and effective treatments available at Deuk Spine Institute. Since the most common cause of spinal stenosis is a bulging disc in the lateral recess or neuroforamen, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the preferred treatment for pinched nerves. After the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, leg symptoms such as pain, weakness, heaviness, numbness and tingling usually go away permanently. Leg pain often resolves first within 1-2 days of treatment while numbness and weakness may take up to 12 months after surgery. Deuk Spine Institute is able to perform all known treatments for spinal stenosis however we have found the best treatment for spinal stenosis to be the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure. You can compare Deuk Laser Disc Repair to other treatments for spinal stenosis including laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous device and fusion to see why our proprietary procedure is safer and more effective.",

To see if you are a candidate for Deuk Laser Disc Repair please complete ourFree MRI Review\r\nFree MRI Review : https://deukspine.com/free-mri-review Motion Preserving\r\nSpinal discs are normally painless joints made for movement, giving the back its flexibility needed for regular daily activities. The ideal treatment for a painful disc would successfully eliminate back pain while preserving the natural movement of the disc. Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patients body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patients natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is different because there is no collateral damage or instability from the procedure. Deuk Laser Disc Repair uses a small  inch skin incision and natural openings already present in the spine to access and treat painful injured discs. Unlike invasive spine surgery, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is a minimally invasive, nontraumatic endoscopic procedure that gently separates delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding or scarring. Since bone, muscle, ligament and joint are unharmed during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. The entire surgery is completed endoscopically under light sedation with same day discharge. Because the injured disc is repaired with laser precision, spinal motion is preserved at the treated disc and all surrounding joints.

    "question": "How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair reduce the need for opioid painkillers post-surgery?",
    "retrieval_context": "Avoid Opioid Narcotic Painkillers\r\nSpine surgery without post operative opioid narcotic painkillers is possible with the Deuk Laser Disc Repair. Invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous devices, spinal fusion and disc replacement always require dangerous post operative opioid narcotic painkillers because these types of surgery cause tremendous damage to your body internally during the surgery. The internal damage cannot be seen under the incision but it is felt by patients as post-surgical pain for months. Most invasive spine surgery patients stay in the hospital overnight taking powerful opioid narcotic painkillers and continue taking them for months after surgery for the pain they experience. What invasive spine surgeons dont tell patients is just how damaging their surgery is to the body and it is all hidden from sight under those scars. The actual source of post-operative pain is dying muscles, bones and ligaments ripped out of your spine while you are sleeping under anesthesia. The invasive surgery destroys muscles along the back of the spine by ripping them off the spine which causes them to melt away for months after the surgery turning them into a stew and eventually hard scar tissue. Dont be fooled into believing this wont happen to you. Liquification of muscles, tendons, bone and ligaments happens in ALL invasive spine surgery which is why you will have so much pain after invasive surgery and require opioid narcotic painkillers for weeks or longer. All patients undergoing invasive spine surgery are at high risk of becoming dependent on painkillers.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is truly minimally invasive spine surgery and causes no known internal damage. Patients have no surgical pain the day after their surgery and no post operative painkillers are needed. Since post operative opioid narcotic painkillers are not needed by patients undergoing the Deuk Laser Disc Repair, patients dont have to worry about becoming addicted to painkillers. Patients can return to work or driving a car the day after their surgery. Most of our patients take one Tylenol the night after surgery and nothing else.

    "question": "What is the impact of Deuk Laser Disc Repair on hospital stays and postoperative recovery?",
    "retrieval_context": "Outpatient\r\nOutpatient surgery is performed outside the hospital with the patient returning home the same day. Most spine surgery is invasive and high risk so surgeons must keep the patient in the hospital for days or weeks and on powerful painkillers to properly treat the after effects of surgery. Hospitals can be dangerous places, teeming with hostile bacteria. After all, sick patients with bad infections are admitted to the hospital for medical care. Why put yourself in that environment?\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair and all Deuk Spine Institutes minimally invasive procedures are performed in the safety of our state-of-the-art spine facilities, free of infection. Patients are always discharged home the same day as their procedure with minimal discomfort and a band aid size incision. Our patients can enjoy a walk on the beach or dinner in a fine restaurant nearby only hours after their surgery. Why would anyone choose a hospital stay when they can go home one hour after their spine surgery and enjoy their time in the way they chose best.

Some take a Tylenol or muscle relaxer the evening of surgery. 50% of our patients are completely pain free the evening of their surgery. By the morning after surgery, 90% of patients are pain free and off all pain medication. Only 10% of patients take a few weeks or longer to become pain free. Many patients chose to return to work the day after surgery while others take a week off. Driving, walking and other normal activities may be resumed the day after surgery. Lifting and bending restrictions are common but time limited.

    "question": "What specific surgical innovations does Deuk Laser Disc Repair incorporate to minimize patient risk and discomfort?",
    "retrieval_context": "The Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure uses precisely targeted laser energy to remove inflammatory tissue, degenerated herniated nucleus pulposus, scar tissue, calcium deposits and bone spurs from within the painful posterior annular tear. With one 30-minute laser treatment, the painful disc becomes permanently painless as natural healing of the disc begins. Pain relief is typically immediate and lasts a lifetime.

The ideal treatment for a painful disc would successfully eliminate back pain while preserving the natural movement of the disc. Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patients body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patients natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is different because there is no collateral damage or instability from the procedure. Deuk Laser Disc Repair uses a small  inch skin incision and natural openings already present in the spine to access and treat painful injured discs. Unlike invasive spine surgery, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is a minimally invasive, nontraumatic endoscopic procedure that gently separates delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding or scarring. Since bone, muscle, ligament and joint are unharmed during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. The entire surgery is completed endoscopically under light sedation with same day discharge. Because the injured disc is repaired with laser precision, spinal motion is preserved at the treated disc and all surrounding joints.
