The ideal treatment for a painful disc would successfully eliminate neck pain while preserving the natural movement of the disc. Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patients body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patients natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is different because there is no collateral damage or instability from the procedure. Deuk Laser Disc Repair uses a small  inch skin incision and natural openings already present in the spine to access and treat painful injured discs.

    "question": "How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair treat spinal stenosis symptoms?",
    "retrieval_context": "Spinal Stenosis\r\nSpinal stenosis is a common finding on MRI scans done for neck pain or pinched nerves. Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the natural channels or holes in the spine. Often nerves run through these channels or holes. If the narrowing is severe enough a pinched nerve will occur. Pinched nerves can cause arm weakness, numbness, tingling or shooting pain down the arm (radiculitis). Spinal stenosis or pinched nerves do NOT cause neck pain, only arm pain can occur. Neck pain usually comes from disc injuries, for example herniated or bulging discs. The most frequent cause of spinal stenosis is a herniated or bulging disc. This is why neck pain and spinal stenosis are commonly found together.\r\nThere are 4 zones in the spine where stenosis can occur. They are from medial to lateral: central, lateral recess, neural foramen and extra-foraminal. The most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the lateral recess. The next most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the neural-foramen. Deuk Spine Institute independently discovered that 98% of problematic spinal stenosis occurs in the lateral recess and neuro-foramen, a fact most doctors are unaware of. Spine surgeons and radiologists are typically only looking for central stenosis and often miss the actual cause of a patients stenosis symptoms, lateral recess and foraminal stenosis. Failure to diagnose and treat the actual source of a pinched nerve is the most common cause of failed neck surgery syndrome where patients have spine surgery that doesnt work and they are in more pain after surgery. As a result of doctors missing the diagnosis, patients often suffer in pain. Deuk Spine Institute is your trusted partner with a 99% diagnostic accuracy for spine conditions.\r\nSpinal stenosis and its associated symptoms are completely curable with the safe and effective treatments available at Deuk Spine Institute. Since the most common cause of spinal stenosis is a bulging disc in the lateral recess or neuroforamen, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the preferred treatment for pinched nerves. After the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, arm symptoms such as pain, weakness, heaviness, numbness and tingling usually go away permanently. Arm pain often resolves first within 1-2 days of treatment while numbness and weakness may take up to 12 months after surgery. Deuk Spine Institute is able to perform all known treatments for spinal stenosis however we have found the best treatment for spinal stenosis to be the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure. You can compare Deuk Laser Disc Repair to other treatments for spinal stenosis including laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous device and fusion to see why our proprietary procedure is safer and more effective.",

    "question": "What typical changes occur in the disc during a herniation?",
    "retrieval_context": "Repair Injured Discs\r\nAll painful disc injuries begin with a traumatic tear of the annulus fibrosus ring around the disc. An annular tear occurs when the traumatic forces on a disc exceed the discs elastic property limits and cause an instantaneous structural failure of both the annulus fibrosus (tear) and adjacent nucleus pulposus (fragmentation) as postulated in 2008 by Deuk Spine Institutes founding neurosurgeon, Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD. At the precise moment of structural failure, linear annular tears occur in the wall of the disc while the adjacent nucleus pulposus is crushed into multiple fragments. Although not all annular tears immediately result in a disc herniation, the tear is a weakened area of the disc wall prone to herniations of the adjacent fragmented nucleus pulposus while under pressure from normal spinal loading. Pressure within the injured disc forces fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus outward into the adjacent annular tear.\r\nDisc herniations occur when fragments of damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tear during normal physical activities such as bending, lifting, twisting, sports, and work. The annulus wall is 1.5 cm thick so the annular tear is long and fragments of herniated disc get stuck within the tear. Once a fragment of nucleus pulposus enters into the annular tear, the annular tear can no longer heal itself closed and inflammation begins to occur within the wall of the annular tear around the herniation. Inflammation is the bodys natural response to the herniation and its attempt to break down the herniation with chemicals released by inflammatory cells. Those chemicals not only cause severe pain by irritating nearby somatic afferent nerve endings but also weaken the wall further making it more susceptible to additional tears. Over time more fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tears and the herniation gets bigger.\r\nDiscogenic neck pain may occur once the herniated fragments of nucleus pulposus reach the outer 1/3 of the posterior annulus fibrosus. The inner 2/3 of the annulus fibrosus normally has no blood vessels, no blood supply and no innervation. Nucleus pulposus fragments present within the outer 1/3 of the annular tear will trigger the bodys inflammatory defense system to turn on and begin to attack the pieces of herniated nucleus pulposus. The resulting inflammation within the walls of the posterior annular tear of an injured disc is the source of discogenic neck pain (pain generator). When the inflammation spreads to nearby nerve roots it causes arm pain (radiculitis). Inflammation lasting weeks or months within the annular tear further weakens the wall and makes the disc more susceptible to reherniation. If left untreated, the annular tear remains open and vulnerable to additional herniation, inflammation and pain occurring in cycles over a lifetime.",

    "retrieval_context": "Deuk Laser Disc Repair was the first and currently is the only procedure in the world to selectively target and repair the inflamed posterior annular tears known to cause chronic neck pain. Using a minimally invasive, endoscopic technique through a 4 mm skin incision, the painful annular tear is located at the back of the injured painful disc. Treatment of the painful tissue within the annular tear is performed using an FDA approved Holmium YAG laser under the direction of a highly trained Deuk Spine Institute surgeon. The surgeon will precisely remove herniated disc, inflammatory tissue, bone spurs, calcium deposits and scar tissue from the posterior annular tear and epidural space around the nerve root. Upon completion of the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, the now painless annular tear will begin healing naturally. It takes 9-12 months for the repaired annular tear to completely heal.

    "question": "What type of anesthesia is used during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure?",
    "retrieval_context": "Restore Spinal Stability\r\nSpinal discs are normally painless joints made for movement, giving the neck its flexibility needed for regular daily activities. The ideal treatment for a painful disc would successfully eliminate neck pain while preserving the natural movement of the disc. Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patients body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patients natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is different because there is no collateral damage or instability from the procedure. Deuk Laser Disc Repair uses a small  inch skin incision and natural openings already present in the spine to access and treat painful injured discs. Unlike invasive spine surgery, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is a minimally invasive, nontraumatic endoscopic procedure that gently separates delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding or scarring. Since bone, muscle, ligament and joint are unharmed during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. The entire surgery is completed endoscopically under general anesthesia with same day discharge. Because the injured disc is repaired with laser precision, spinal motion is preserved at the treated disc and all surrounding joints.

    "question": "What are some of the specific symptoms of cervical radiculopathy mentioned?",
    "retrieval_context": "Spinal Stenosis\r\nSpinal stenosis is a common finding on MRI scans done for neck pain or pinched nerves. Spinal stenosis is an abnormal narrowing of the natural channels or holes in the spine. Often nerves run through these channels or holes. If the narrowing is severe enough a pinched nerve will occur. Pinched nerves can cause arm weakness, numbness, tingling or shooting pain down the arm (radiculitis). Spinal stenosis or pinched nerves do NOT cause neck pain, only arm pain can occur. Neck pain usually comes from disc injuries, for example herniated or bulging discs. The most frequent cause of spinal stenosis is a herniated or bulging disc. This is why neck pain and spinal stenosis are commonly found together.\r\nThere are 4 zones in the spine where stenosis can occur. They are from medial to lateral: central, lateral recess, neural foramen and extra-foraminal. The most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the lateral recess. The next most common zone for symptomatic stenosis is the neural-foramen. Deuk Spine Institute independently discovered that 98% of problematic spinal stenosis occurs in the lateral recess and neuro-foramen, a fact most doctors are unaware of. Spine surgeons and radiologists are typically only looking for central stenosis and often miss the actual cause of a patients stenosis symptoms, lateral recess and foraminal stenosis. Failure to diagnose and treat the actual source of a pinched nerve is the most common cause of failed neck surgery syndrome where patients have spine surgery that doesnt work and they are in more pain after surgery. As a result of doctors missing the diagnosis, patients often suffer in pain. Deuk Spine Institute is your trusted partner with a 99% diagnostic accuracy for spine conditions.\r\nSpinal stenosis and its associated symptoms are completely curable with the safe and effective treatments available at Deuk Spine Institute. Since the most common cause of spinal stenosis is a bulging disc in the lateral recess or neuroforamen, Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the preferred treatment for pinched nerves. After the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, arm symptoms such as pain, weakness, heaviness, numbness and tingling usually go away permanently. Arm pain often resolves first within 1-2 days of treatment while numbness and weakness may take up to 12 months after surgery. Deuk Spine Institute is able to perform all known treatments for spinal stenosis however we have found the best treatment for spinal stenosis to be the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure. You can compare Deuk Laser Disc Repair to other treatments for spinal stenosis including laminectomy, discectomy, interspinous device and fusion to see why our proprietary procedure is safer and more effective.",

    "question": "What percentage of Deuk Spine Institute�s diagnostic for neck pain generators is accurate?",
    "retrieval_context": "Motion Preserving\r\nChronic neck pain can be cured when the exact source of pain is identified and properly treated. Thirty distinct sources of chronic neck pain are now known. Most patients with chronic neck pain have more than one source. The actual source of a patients pain is referred to as the \"pain generator\". The most common pain generator for chronic neck pain is injured discs in the cervical spine. Injured discs such as disc herniation, disc bulge, slipped disc, disc protrusion, disc extrusion, disc degeneration, and spondylosis account for 85% of all chronic neck pain. Disc injuries are by far the most common cause of neck pain. Damaged facet joints such as facet arthropathy and hypertrophy are the second most common cause of chronic neck pain accounting for 15% in total. Finally, less than 1% of chronic neck pain is due to less common pain generators including vertebral fracture, tumor and infection. Correct diagnosis of a patients specific pain generators requires a specialized physical exam and a recent cervical MRI scan. Occasionally, diagnostic nerve blocks are needed to aid in the diagnosis of facet joint pain. Although many people suffer with chronic neck pain, each patient is unique in how they experience pain.\r\nDeuk Spine Institute is the first medical facility in the world to achieve 99% diagnostic accuracy identifying neck pain generators through its use of advanced medical imaging combined with a proprietary physical exam technique developed at Deuk Spine Institute called the Deuk Spine Exam. The Deuk Spine Exam uses novel neck pain mapping technology to identify neck pain generators with real time diagnostic accuracy over 99%. Unfortunately, most doctors worldwide still believe neck pain to be nonspecific having no identifiable source, thus leaving patients with no hope for a successful treatment recommendation.Subsequently, many neck pain treatments are done without an accurate diagnosis therefore the treatments are ineffective or short lived. Deuk Spine Institutes lead researcher, Arias Deukmedjian and founder Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD were the first to discover that most (85%) chronic neck pain originates from a microscopic tearin the posterior annulus fibrosus (wall) of the disc. While unable to heal on its own, the annular tear can be seen and repaired during endoscopic spine surgery. The endoscopic surgery has been peer reviewed and published as the Deuk Laser Disc Repair.\r\nDeuk Laser Disc Repair is the first fully FDA compliant spine surgery in the world to specifically target the most common cause of chronic neck pain, an inflamed posterior annular tear within an injured cervical spinal disc.",

    "question": "How does an annular tear contribute to disc herniation?",
    "retrieval_context": "Repair Injured Discs\r\nAll painful disc injuries begin with a traumatic tear of the annulus fibrosus ring around the disc. An annular tear occurs when the traumatic forces on a disc exceed the discs elastic property limits and cause an instantaneous structural failure of both the annulus fibrosus (tear) and adjacent nucleus pulposus (fragmentation) as postulated in 2008 by Deuk Spine Institutes founding neurosurgeon, Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD. At the precise moment of structural failure, linear annular tears occur in the wall of the disc while the adjacent nucleus pulposus is crushed into multiple fragments. Although not all annular tears immediately result in a disc herniation, the tear is a weakened area of the disc wall prone to herniations of the adjacent fragmented nucleus pulposus while under pressure from normal spinal loading. Pressure within the injured disc forces fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus outward into the adjacent annular tear.\r\nDisc herniations occur when fragments of damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tear during normal physical activities such as bending, lifting, twisting, sports, and work. The annulus wall is 1.5 cm thick so the annular tear is long and fragments of herniated disc get stuck within the tear. Once a fragment of nucleus pulposus enters into the annular tear, the annular tear can no longer heal itself closed and inflammation begins to occur within the wall of the annular tear around the herniation. Inflammation is the bodys natural response to the herniation and its attempt to break down the herniation with chemicals released by inflammatory cells. Those chemicals not only cause severe pain by irritating nearby somatic afferent nerve endings but also weaken the wall further making it more susceptible to additional tears. Over time more fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tears and the herniation gets bigger.\r\nDiscogenic neck pain may occur once the herniated fragments of nucleus pulposus reach the outer 1/3 of the posterior annulus fibrosus. The inner 2/3 of the annulus fibrosus normally has no blood vessels, no blood supply and no innervation. Nucleus pulposus fragments present within the outer 1/3 of the annular tear will trigger the bodys inflammatory defense system to turn on and begin to attack the pieces of herniated nucleus pulposus. The resulting inflammation within the walls of the posterior annular tear of an injured disc is the source of discogenic neck pain (pain generator). When the inflammation spreads to nearby nerve roots it causes arm pain (radiculitis). Inflammation lasting weeks or months within the annular tear further weakens the wall and makes the disc more susceptible to reherniation. If left untreated, the annular tear remains open and vulnerable to additional herniation, inflammation and pain occurring in cycles over a lifetime.",

Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the most effective treatment in the world for the most common cause of chronic neck pain: painful, inflamed annular tears within an injured discs back wall. Chronic means neck pain lasting or recurring for more than 6 weeks. It is known that 85% of all chronic neck pain comes from inflammation within the tears found in the back walls of injured spinal discs. The key role that inflammation plays in discogenic neck pain was discovered endoscopically by founding neurosurgeon Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD in 2007 and remains the basis of the Deuk Laser Disc Repair treatment. Painful annular tears are found within herniated, slipped, ruptured, bulging, protruding, extruded and degenerated discs in the spine. The Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure directly targets and debrides painful annular tears with laser energy and precision. Discogenic neck pain is eliminated completely and immediately with the treatment.

    "question": "How does the location of annular tears influence their ability to heal naturally?",
    "retrieval_context": "Repair Injured Discs\r\nAll painful disc injuries begin with a traumatic tear of the annulus fibrosus ring around the disc. An annular tear occurs when the traumatic forces on a disc exceed the discs elastic property limits and cause an instantaneous structural failure of both the annulus fibrosus (tear) and adjacent nucleus pulposus (fragmentation) as postulated in 2008 by Deuk Spine Institutes founding neurosurgeon, Dr. Ara Deukmedjian MD. At the precise moment of structural failure, linear annular tears occur in the wall of the disc while the adjacent nucleus pulposus is crushed into multiple fragments. Although not all annular tears immediately result in a disc herniation, the tear is a weakened area of the disc wall prone to herniations of the adjacent fragmented nucleus pulposus while under pressure from normal spinal loading. Pressure within the injured disc forces fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus outward into the adjacent annular tear.\r\nDisc herniations occur when fragments of damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tear during normal physical activities such as bending, lifting, twisting, sports, and work. The annulus wall is 1.5 cm thick so the annular tear is long and fragments of herniated disc get stuck within the tear. Once a fragment of nucleus pulposus enters into the annular tear, the annular tear can no longer heal itself closed and inflammation begins to occur within the wall of the annular tear around the herniation. Inflammation is the bodys natural response to the herniation and its attempt to break down the herniation with chemicals released by inflammatory cells. Those chemicals not only cause severe pain by irritating nearby somatic afferent nerve endings but also weaken the wall further making it more susceptible to additional tears. Over time more fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus push out through the annular tears and the herniation gets bigger.\r\nDiscogenic neck pain may occur once the herniated fragments of nucleus pulposus reach the outer 1/3 of the posterior annulus fibrosus. The inner 2/3 of the annulus fibrosus normally has no blood vessels, no blood supply and no innervation. Nucleus pulposus fragments present within the outer 1/3 of the annular tear will trigger the bodys inflammatory defense system to turn on and begin to attack the pieces of herniated nucleus pulposus. The resulting inflammation within the walls of the posterior annular tear of an injured disc is the source of discogenic neck pain (pain generator). When the inflammation spreads to nearby nerve roots it causes arm pain (radiculitis). Inflammation lasting weeks or months within the annular tear further weakens the wall and makes the disc more susceptible to reherniation. If left untreated, the annular tear remains open and vulnerable to additional herniation, inflammation and pain occurring in cycles over a lifetime.",

    "question": "Why is the conventional spine surgery considered less safe compared to Deuk Laser Disc Repair?",
    "retrieval_context": "Bloodless Spine Surgery\r\nSpinal instability was originally defined in 1978 by Dr. White MD and Dr. Panjabi PhD as the inability of the spine under normal physiological loads to prevent deformation causing neck pain or neurological compromise. Spinal disc injuries including herniated and bulging discs are the most common cause of spinal instability. Procedures that eliminate neck pain or nerve root symptoms by definition enhance spinal stability. Many procedures have the capacity to improve symptoms of spinal instability, but few provide lasting results. Some of the procedures are highly invasive causing more injury to the patients body than just the spine. Invasive spine surgery includes laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement, interspinous devices and spinal cord stimulators. Invasive spine surgery always permanently damages soft tissues, bone and joints around the spine leading to long term instability and the need for additional spine surgery.\r\nThe Deuk Laser Disc Repair is the only procedure capable of stabilizing the spine without causing collateral damage to spinal muscles, joints, ligaments and tendons. A small  inch incision is made in the skin and the rest of the surgery is performed endoscopically without internal damage or scar tissue. Pain relief is immediate and most patients experience neurological improvement within 24 hours. Deuk Laser Disc Repair is capable of restoring spinal stability.

The average blood loss for a Deuk Laser Disc Repair is 1.5 milliliters or about 30 drops. The average blood loss for invasive spine surgery is 100 times more. While blood transfusions are uncommon in surgery, excessive blood loss is not uncommon with invasive spine surgery such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, disc replacement and spinal devices. Blood loss over 1,500 milliliters has been reported with invasive spine surgery leading to cardiovascular collapse and death. Peace of mind before surgery is important and no spine surgery affords greater safety and reliability than Deuk Laser Disc Repair. Treat yourself to the best spine surgery available.
