Level: Medium
Q1. How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair treat spinal stenosis symptoms?
A: It is the preferred treatment for pinched nerves and resolves arm pain often associated with spinal stenosis.

Q2. What typical changes occur in the disc during a herniation?
A: Fragments of damaged nucleus pulposus push out through annular tears during normal physical activities.

Q3. How does the healing process work for Deuk Laser Disc Repair?
A: The procedure allows natural healing to begin, and full recovery of the treated area can take 9-12 months.

Q4. What type of anesthesia is used during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure?
A: General anesthesia.

Q5. What are some of the specific symptoms of cervical radiculopathy mentioned?
A: Arm pain (radiculitis).

Q6. Why are postoperative opioid narcotics not needed after Deuk Laser Disc Repair?
A: The procedure is minimally invasive, causing no known internal damage, thus eliminating the need for strong painkillers.

Q7. How long is the typical recovery period right after Deuk Laser Disc Repair?
A: Patients typically recover within one hour after surgery.

Q8. What percentage of Deuk Spine Instituteï¿½s diagnostic for neck pain generators is accurate?
A: Over 99%.

Q9. What spinal issues do Deuk Laser Disc Repair treat?
A: Discogenic neck pain, spinal stenosis, and other disc injuries.

Q10. What percentage of problematic spinal stenosis occurs in the lateral recess and neuro-foramen according to Deuk Spine Institute?
A: 98%

Level: Difficult
Q1. How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair maintain spinal stability after the procedure?
A: By using minimally invasive techniques that do not damage bones, muscles, or ligaments, thereby preserving natural movement and stability of the spine.

Q2. Describe the mechanism by which Deuk Laser Disc Repair alleviates pain from inflamed annular tears.
A: It targets and debrides the painful annular tears using a laser, removing inflammatory tissue and other elements, which leads to immediate and permanent pain relief.

Q3. Explain why patients are less likely to become addicted to painkillers after undergoing Deuk Laser Disc Repair.
A: Because the surgery does not require postoperative opioid narcotics, thus reducing the risk of dependency.

Q4. What is the Deuk Spine Exam?
A: A proprietary physical exam technique developed at Deuk Spine Institute that uses neck pain mapping technology to identify neck pain generators with over 99% accuracy.

Q5. How does an annular tear contribute to disc herniation?
A: Pressure within the injured disc forces fragments of the damaged nucleus pulposus outward into the annular tear, which can no longer heal itself, leading to herniation.

Q6. What factors contribute to the overall effectiveness of Deuk Laser Disc Repair in treating spinal conditions?
A: Its minimally invasive approach, precise treatment targeting, and ability to provide immediate pain relief while preserving spinal motion.

Q7. What advanced technology is used during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair?
A: FDA approved Holmium YAG laser.

Q8. Discuss the role of inflammation in discogenic neck pain as found by Dr. Ara Deukmedjian.
A: Inflammation within the tears in the back walls of injured spinal discs plays a key role in discogenic neck pain, as discovered in 2007 by Dr. Ara Deukmedjian.

Q9. How does the location of annular tears influence their ability to heal naturally?
A: Annular tears occur in the wall of the disc and if they are within the outer 1/3 where nerve innervation exists, they can cause inflammation and pain, preventing natural healing without intervention.

Q10. Why is the conventional spine surgery considered less safe compared to Deuk Laser Disc Repair?
A: Conventional procedures often involve more invasive techniques that result in higher internal damage, extensive recovery, and the need for opioid pain management, which Deuk Laser Disc Repair avoids.
