Q10: How does Deuk Laser Disc Repair contrast with traditional invasive spine surgeries in terms of patient outcomes and recovery?
A: Unlike traditional spine surgeries, Deuk Laser Disc Repair offers immediate recovery, minimal post-surgical pain, and avoids the long-term negative effects of invasive procedures, such as loss of mobility and structural stability.
DS : Deuk Laser Disc Repair is a minimally invasive, nontraumatic endoscopic procedure that gently separates delicate tissue around the spine without harm, bleeding or scarring. Since bone, muscle, ligament and joint are unharmed during the Deuk Laser Disc Repair procedure, natural movement and stability of the spine are maintained. The entire surgery is completed endoscopically under light sedation with same day discharge. Because the injured disc is repaired with laser precision, spinal motion is preserved at the treated disc and all surrounding joints.
Invasive spine surgeries such as laminectomy, discectomy, spinal fusion, microdiscectomy, interspinous devices and the artificial discs permanently interfere with the natural movement of the spine because these treatments intentionally remove or destroy the normal bones, ligaments, muscles, and joints from the spine. Collateral damage to the patients body caused by invasive spine surgery is often ignored by the surgeons who are pushing these dangerous but profitable types of surgery onto unsuspecting patients. Invasive spine surgery damages not only the spinal disc and surrounding ligaments, bones and muscles also permanently altering the patients natural posture, gait, station, and balance leading to a lifetime of agonizing joint and muscle issues from postsurgical spinal instability. Fusion of the spine becomes necessary to treat this postoperative instability after the invasive surgery. Spinal fusion itself always results in permanent loss of movement. The best way to avoid spinal fusion is to avoid invasive spine surgery in the first place.
